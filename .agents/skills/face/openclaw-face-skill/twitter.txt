Gave my AI agent a physical face using Carbonyl (terminal Chromium) and a spare display.

It updates its expression based on what it's doing - happy when idle, thinking when processing, sleepy at night.

Surprisingly delightful to walk past and see it "looking" back.

ALT VERSION (shorter):

My AI agent now has a face.

Carbonyl renders HTML to a terminal display. Agent updates an SVG to show emotions.

Happy when idle. Thinking when busy. Sleepy at 3am.

THREAD VERSION:

1/ Gave my AI agent a physical face and it's surprisingly delightful.

2/ Setup: Linux box + display + Carbonyl (Chromium that renders to terminal). Agent writes HTML, Carbonyl displays it. Refreshes every 30s.

3/ The face is just SVG - move the pupils, change the mouth shape. Happy, thinking, sleepy expressions.

4/ There's something about giving an AI a physical presence. Walking past my NAS and seeing it "look back" makes it feel less like code and more like... something.

5/ Packaged it as an OpenClaw skill. Install with:
npx clawhub@latest install face
