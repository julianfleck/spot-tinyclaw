# Triage Rules — Retrieval Architectures

## Highlight (max 3, detailed writeup)

Include if:
- Novel graph structure for retrieval (temporal, hypergraph, community)
- New recursive/multi-hop retrieval mechanism
- Advances hybrid symbolic-neural retrieval
- Directly applicable to RAGE frame navigation
- Strong empirical results on multi-hop benchmarks

## Scan (table row)

Include if:
- Incremental GraphRAG improvements
- New retrieval benchmarks with insight
- Efficiency improvements with architectural interest
- Application of graph retrieval to new domains

## Skip

- Basic single-vector RAG papers
- Embedding fine-tuning only
- Pure latency/token optimization
- Papers without retrieval architecture contribution
