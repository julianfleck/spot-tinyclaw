# Triage Rules — Memory Architectures

## Highlight (max 3, detailed writeup)

Include if:
- Novel memory architecture (not incremental)
- New consolidation or forgetting mechanism
- Advances schema-based or constructivist approaches
- Directly relevant to RAGE frame semantics
- From known active groups (BAAI, Tsinghua, Alibaba DAMO, DeepMind, Anthropic)

## Scan (table row)

Include if:
- Worth knowing about but not groundbreaking
- Incremental improvements to known architectures
- Good benchmarking of memory approaches
- Application of memory patterns to new domains

## Skip

- Pure prompt engineering for "memory"
- Vector DB integrations without architecture
- Conversation history management only
- Papers older than 2 weeks unless exceptional
