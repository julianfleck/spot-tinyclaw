## Highlight (max 3, detailed writeup)

Include if:
- Explicitly addresses maintaining reasoning diversity
- Novel mechanism for anti-convergent generation
- Serendipity or surprise in retrieval/generation
- pass@k optimization with architectural insight
- Directly relates to Julian's divergence engine concept

## Scan (table row)

Include if:
- Tangentially related diversity work
- Exploration/exploitation analysis in LLM context
- Multi-path reasoning without explicit divergence framing
- Creative generation with some architectural insight

## Skip

- Diversity purely for data augmentation
- Temperature/sampling diversity only
- Creative writing applications
- Papers using "diverse" in unrelated sense
