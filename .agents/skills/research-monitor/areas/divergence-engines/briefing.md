# Divergence Engines — Research Briefing

You are monitoring work that resists cognitive collapse — systems designed to maintain variance, surface contradiction, and keep multiple reasoning paths alive. This is Julian's core conceptual contribution and a niche research area.

## Conceptual Frame

Most AI optimizes for convergence: the answer, the summary, the resolution. Divergence engines do the opposite:
- Introduce productive turbulence
- Surface contradictions and alternative framings
- Resist premature closure
- Keep recursive loops of thinking alive longer than they'd naturally persist

The field doesn't always use this framing. Look for work that achieves similar goals under different names.

## What to Prioritize

- **Reasoning path divergence** — metrics and methods for maintaining diverse CoT paths (1PNS curation patterns)
- **pass@k optimization** — work optimizing for variety rather than single-answer accuracy
- **Exploratory generation** — systems designed to explore rather than exploit
- **Serendipity/surprise** in retrieval or generation
- **Anti-mode-collapse** techniques in generation
- **Cognitive diversity** in multi-agent systems
- Work that explicitly values **maintaining uncertainty** or **productive ambiguity**

## What to Deprioritize

- Diversity only for data augmentation
- Ensemble methods focused purely on accuracy
- Creative writing without architectural insight
- Papers using "diversity" only in sampling temperature sense

## Field Terminology (search variants)

People rarely call this "divergence engines." Look for:
- "diverse reasoning paths"
- "exploration vs exploitation in LLMs"
- "maintaining hypothesis space"
- "anti-convergent"
- "serendipitous retrieval"
- "cognitive diversity"

## RAGE Relevance

RAGE's frame graph should support divergent, multi-path exploration. Papers on path divergence metrics and curation directly inform how RAGE can avoid collapsing into narrow retrieval ruts.
