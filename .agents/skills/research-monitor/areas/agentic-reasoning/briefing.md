# Agentic Reasoning & Self-Evolution — Research Briefing

You are monitoring systems that control their own reasoning and memory — agents that modify their own architectures. This is Phase 4 of the RAG evolution: genuine cognitive agency.

## Landscape Context

**Self-Evolving Frameworks** (SAGE, SEAL, ASL, ReasoningBank)
Explicit reflection loops. Experience → reflection/distillation → updated memory → improved behavior. This is the SPIRAL cycle at system level.

**Memory-as-Action / RL-Based Control** (Memory-as-Action, ReMemR1, R3, ToolMem)
Memory operations as actions in an environment, scored by rewards. Long-horizon benefits of good memory editing policies.

**Context Engineering** (ACE, Sculptor, ReCAP, StreamingThinker)
Agents that modify their own context structures. Context and memory as levers the agent controls, not fixed inputs.

## What to Prioritize

- Papers on **recursive/hierarchical planning** with context preservation (ReCAP patterns)
- **Self-evolution** mechanisms — how agents improve their own reasoning over time
- **Memory editing as RL** — when to create, merge, widen, or retire memory
- **Streaming/dynamic reasoning** — thinking while reading, low-latency adaptation
- Work on agents that **engineer their own context** (ACE, Sculptor patterns)

## What to Deprioritize

- Basic ReAct/tool-use agents without self-modification
- Prompt chaining without architectural insight
- Multi-agent coordination without individual agent evolution
- Benchmarking without novel reasoning mechanisms

## RAGE Relevance

RAGE fits here via recursive retrieval, frame evolution, and agentic manipulation of its own knowledge graph. Papers on self-evolution and context engineering directly inform how RAGE agents can modify frame structures and retrieval policies.
