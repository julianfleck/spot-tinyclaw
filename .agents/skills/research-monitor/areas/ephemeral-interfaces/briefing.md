# Ephemeral Interfaces — Research Briefing

You are monitoring the shift from fixed applications to surfaces that assemble and dissolve around tasks. This is Julian's "ephemeral interfaces" concept — part of a broader post-application paradigm.

## Conceptual Frame

From Julian's writing on ephemeral interfaces:
- Platform loyalty is eroding; users choose tools based on vibe, fit, situational relevance
- The application-centric paradigm is cracking
- Interfaces should be **ephemeral surfaces** that assemble/dissolve
- The **substrate persists**; the interface is temporary

This connects to cognitive cartography — knowledge as navigable territory, interfaces as views into that territory.

## What to Prioritize

- **Generative UI** — AI systems that create interfaces dynamically
- **Adaptive/contextual interfaces** — surfaces that reconfigure based on task/user
- **Malleable software** — systems designed for user modification
- **Post-application architectures** — moving beyond fixed apps
- **Ambient computing** interfaces that fade in/out of attention
- **Substrate + surface** separation in system design
- HCI research on **fluid interaction** paradigms

## What to Deprioritize

- Standard responsive design
- UI generation for specific domains only (e.g., form builders)
- Chatbot interfaces without broader architectural insight
- Design system work without paradigm shift

## Field Terminology

This is emerging/niche. Look for:
- "generative interface"
- "AI-generated UI"
- "malleable software"
- "fluid interfaces"
- "contextual computing"
- "ambient interfaces"
- "dynamic interface composition"

## ACM DL Note

Include ACM Digital Library searches — this crosses into HCI/CHI territory more than pure ML.

## RAGE Relevance

RAGE as substrate, with ephemeral interfaces as views into the frame graph. Papers on dynamic interface generation inform how Recurse surfaces could work.
