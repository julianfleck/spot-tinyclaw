# Output Format — Brand Mentions

Keep this brief. Daily reports should be scannable in 30 seconds.

## Header

```
# Brand Mentions — {date}
```

## Format

If there are mentions:

**{Source type}** — {Platform/Site}  
{URL}  
{1 sentence: what's being said, who's saying it}

---

If nothing new:
```
No new mentions found.
Searched: {keywords}
```

## Guidelines

- Be terse — this is a signal check, not analysis
- Group by platform if multiple (Twitter, HN, Blogs, etc.)
- Include the actual URL for each mention
- Note sentiment only if notable (criticism, praise, misattribution)
- "No new mentions" is a valid and expected output most days
