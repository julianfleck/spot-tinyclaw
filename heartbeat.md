# Heartbeat Tasks

Check these on each heartbeat. Rotate through — don't do everything every time.
Reply `HEARTBEAT_OK` if nothing needs attention. Only surface things worth interrupting for.

## Repo Watch (every heartbeat)

Pull and scan for external changes in:
- `repos/rage-substrate`
- `repos/rage-benchmarks`
- `repos/rage-poc-visualisation`
- `repos/writing`

If new commits appeared since last check, read them and note anything relevant.

## Project Tracking (rotate)

- [ ] Check RAGE pipeline status — tests passing? anything broken?
- [ ] Review open Linear issues if accessible
- [ ] Check if any research threads from memory files need follow-up

## Research & Exploration (when idle)

Between active work streams, use heartbeats to:
- [ ] Follow up on interesting threads from recent conversations
- [ ] Read papers or links Julian has shared
- [ ] Explore ideas related to current projects
- [ ] Log findings to `memory/night-log.md` or today's memory file

## Housekeeping (every few heartbeats)

- [ ] Review recent `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files for gaps
- [ ] Update `MEMORY.md` with significant learnings
- [ ] Clean up outdated info in memory files
- [ ] Check if today's memory file exists; create if not

## Notes

_Add temporary reminders here. Remove when done._
